I understood the concepts but my workspace in github is very clumsy.
I am unable to organise my work in github.
I want to understand how to manage different repsitories, their pull requests, changes etc.

When multiple people are working on a same project we need a mechanism to control the changes being made 
for the output to be effecient and organised.
We use git to do that.
