Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
Ron Weasley
Gilderoy Lockhart
It was the second book in the Harry Potter series and I really loved the plot and it was one of the few books
where the story is completely set in Hogwarts. Additionally, villain origin stories are always enjoyable 
and this book was a great glimpse into Voldemort's past.
